## Books I'm reading

At some point I'll get around to updating this.

## Software of the moment

Software I use, presented in the order that I'm remembering them as I type this out.

### macOS Apps

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  > The only editor that "sticks" for me. I can't believe just how much VSCode has "gotten right". Right now I have it set up to effectively be a blend of Vim, Spacemacs, Sublime Text, and IntelliJ, and somehow it's not falling over. Excellent piece of software, 10/10 [with rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/).

- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)

  > A screenshot tool that finally doesn't leave me frustrated, and works so well that I don't even have to think about it. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, "just enough" UI, and a smooth experience.

- [Due](https://www.dueapp.com/)

  > The only reason I remember important things anymore. I don't remember what life was like before Due, but I'm sure I was letting people down left and right.

- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

  > A calendar app that is intuitive to use and has never let me down over the years. Easily an app I'll likely still be using in another 5.

- [Linear](https://linear.app/)

  > When I want to manage my own side projects, I turn to Linear. It's like a Jira + GitHub projects tool that doesn't feel frustrating to use.

- [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/)

  > Wunderlists' "successor", it's actually surprisingly nice for simple lists of information, presented in a clear way, with many of the features that I personally found useful from its predecessor. It does everything I need that isn't "important" - that goes in my next list item.

- [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/)

  > OmniFocus is a fantastically powerful, flexible piece of software. I don't think I'd be able to stay on top of all of the important things I need to do if I didn't use OmniFocus. I've tried so many task tracking applications, and this one is perfectly suited to my needs, and I have workflows that are now in my fingertips that I am at a loss for when I move to a "shiny new thing" to check out and see if it'll replace it. One day, I'll write about all this. One day.

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

  > A great way to split windows on the Mac. The keyboard shortcuts for moving things around is baked into my fingers at this point. I ended up donating to the maintainer a few times over the years because I simply can't believe that it's still free.

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

  > The only way I'm able to use my laptop keyboard these days. I use a lot of custom keyboards and have come up with keymaps that I miss when I go back to my laptop keyboard, and Karabiner is the only reason why I'm able to even "get by" for more than 5 minutes when I want to be somewhere other than my desk.

- [Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/)

  > I keep this open all the time with running calculations that I can't be bothered to do by hand. A life saver for conversions, complex one-off equations, etc.

- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)

  > My preferred git front-end application on the Mac these days. Often I don't even touch `git` directly anymore, and that's almost entirely because of this app.

You might have noticed a complete lack of note apps in this list. It's not because I don't like any, it's just that every single one I use has some flaw or flaws that just don't keep me hooked to it, that are solved by another application, which in turn has shortcomings, and so on and so forth. If you _ever_ find a note app that you think can satisfy my needs, please [get in touch](mailto:julian.m.tor@gmail.com).

### CLI Tooling

- [lnav](https://github.com/tstack/lnav)

  > If you need to review logs locally, I can't think of a better piece of software that runs in the terminal. Has saved me tons of time over the last several years.

- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

  > A fuzzy finder in the terminal that I think should come standard on every installation. So flexible that it can work with basically any list of options. One of the first CLI tools that truly blew my mind when I found it.

- [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

  > A pleasant column-based file browser (the only sane way to browse a file system, don't @ me) for the terminal. Sometimes I go days without opening the Finder, and that's almost entirely because of this tool.

- [`neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

  > I don't use `neovim` as much as I used to anymore, but it's really the only editor that might steal my attention away from VSCode again in the coming years. Really love the work that's been happening there, and I watch their project with great interest - most of the time what I hate about using other editors is that editing in anything other than vim just sucks - I have huge hopes for `neovim`'s "embeddability" taking over the world.

- [`qmk`](https://qmk.fm/)

  > The software powering one of my biggest hobbies, keyboards. QMK is a blessing.

### Fonts of Choice

- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) (_just slightly_ ahead of [SF Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/), IMO)
- [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter)
